# CSE-240A-Branch-Predictor

The purpose of this project is to simulate multiple Branch Predictors and calculate the mispredction rates for given traces.

We have implemented the following Predictors : 
1. GSHARE (with 2 bit Counters)
2. TOURNAMENT (with all 2 bit Counters)
3. Tour-SHARE (i.e. Replaced Global Predictor in Tournament with GSHARE to improve the midprediction rates)
